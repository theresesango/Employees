Currently no working API - Only accessable for code viewing purpose. 

## The Assignment
- Fetch data from Api

- I've decided to use NextJs and to deploy with vercel

- WCAG – I chose a forward and background color that that are AAA level. I've checked on both Site Improve and chromes Lighthouse for any accessibilty flaws, and applyed color blindness filters. (It looks aweful, but prove the point)

- Responsive: Looks fine, I could have added one more break point to touch it up a notch. 

- Screen reader functionallity: Tested with voiceover. 

- Css modules:  some global styling and some component base styling.

- Functions: Filter by name and office.

- Available on a free public url – Deployed with Vercel 

- Typescript

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
